Dear Dr. Ventura:
 
Peggy Tinsley was seen in the Renal Clinic today.  Her chief
symptomatic complaint is severe pruritus, which has not improved
much with Benadryl.  She has yet to fill the prescription for Sarna
lotion.  Her diarrhea has improved with Imodium, and she brought in
samples for cultures today.  Her appetite has improved somewhat.
She notes exertional fatigue and shortness of breath.  Medications
include Phoslo 1 tablet t.i.d., Lasix 160 mg b.i.d., Altase  2.5 mg
b.i.d., Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d., NPH 10 units q.d., iron t.i.d.
 
On examination, weight was 46.8 kilos, which is stable.  Heart rate
was 72, blood pressure 130/64.  JVP was clearly seen at 6 cm
greater than the sternal angle, and there was 1 plus peripheral
edema.  There was no S3.  Chest examination revealed bibasilar
inspiratory crackles.  Her left hand is no longer cold, but the
PTFE graft remains slightly edematous.
 
Blood work from May 30th showed a hematocrit of 23, potassium 5.2,
bicarbonate 15, BUN 91, creatinine 7.9, calcium 5.5., phosphate
5.2, albumin 3.4.
 
We will continue to hold off on dialysis until such time as Peggy's
PTFE graft is suitable.  This will save her the additional
morbidity of a semipermanent IJ catheter.  She is more hypervolemic
than last week, and I added Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg in the morning to her
diuretic regimen.  By oversight, she was not started on Rocaltrol,
and I have started her on Rocaltrol .25 mcg p.o. q.d., and
Nephrocaps 1 p.o. q.d.
