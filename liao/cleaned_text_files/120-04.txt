HARDY,TERESA   360-52-41-3                    VISIT DATE: 12/03/75
This patient was seen concurrently with Dr. Jeter, whose note I 
have reviewed and with which I agree. 
PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 56-year-old female who 
presents with complaints of chest pain.  The patient has a known 
history of coronary artery disease and most recently had a stent 
placed in April of 2075.  The patient had an episode of chest 
tightness with dyspnea while walking to catch a bus.  The patient 
states that this is unusual for her.  She does not usually have 
discomfort with exertion since having her stent placed.  That did 
resolve with rest and now the patient states she had a just "trace" 
of chest tightness throughout the day otherwise.  The patient came 
to Abbeville General Hospital and while walking uphill towards 
the hospital entrance she had recurrence of her discomfort.  The 
patient is pain-free on arrival to the emergency department.   
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the written note. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 
angioplasty, stent, coronary artery disease, pulmonary 
hypertension. 
MEDICATIONS:  Glyburide, aspirin, Lasix, and otherwise as per the 
written note.
ALLERGIES:  Actifed.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished 
female in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.9, pulse 
87, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 161/93.  Oxygen saturation 
is 98% on room air.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are 
equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular 
motions are intact.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No 
crackles.  No wheezes.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  
Physical exam is otherwise as per the written note.  
LABORATORY EVALUATION: Labs are significant for an EKG which shows 
a sinus rhythm at 87 beats per minute.  There are 1-mm ST 
depressions in leads V5 and V6.  This was compared to a prior EKG 
from July 2075 and was found to be without significant change.  The 
only new change on the EKG is that a previously biphasic T-wave in 
V4 is now upright.  Glucose is 215, BUN 21, creatinine 1.1, sodium 
140, potassium 3.9, chloride 100, bicarb 32, CK 321, MB 3.1, trauma 
0.07, calcium 9.4, white count 8.8, hematocrit 40.1, platelets 247, 
PT 11.3, PTT 25.0.  Urinalysis shows no blood, no leukocyte 
esterase, no nitrates.  Chest x-ray shows no infiltrate, no 
pulmonary edema.
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated 
in the emergency department with labs and studies obtained as 
documented above.  The patient's history is concerning for angina.  
The patient received an aspirin, as well as Lopressor, while in the 
emergency department.  She has remained pain-free throughout her 
period of observation while in the emergency department.  The 
patient will require serial cardiac enzymes due to her most recent 
chest discomfort being en route to the hospital and if these are 
unremarkable the patient will require a functional cardiac study 
such as an exercise tolerance test. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Angina.
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
admitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition.
